# spline_to_dat

This skript for fusion 360 exports a airfoil spline as dat file.
Sketch a fittet spline from the tail along the top of the airfoil to origin in xy-plane. Got from there along the bottom to the tail.
The skript lets you select the spline, adds the selected amount off fitpoints and writes the normalized data to a dat-file in selig-format.
